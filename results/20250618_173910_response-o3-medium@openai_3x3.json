            "prompt": "\n\nTHE PUZZLE: \nThere are 3 houses, numbered 1 to 3 from left to right, as seen from across the street. Each house is occupied by a different person. Each house has a unique attribute for each of the following characteristics:\n - Each person has a unique name: `Peter`, `Eric`, `Arnold`\n - Each person has a unique level of education: `bachelor`, `associate`, `high school`\n - Each person has an occupation: `teacher`, `doctor`, `engineer`\n\n## Clues:\n1. The person who is a teacher is directly left of the person with an associate's degree.\n2. The person with an associate's degree and Eric are next to each other.\n3. Peter is the person with a high school diploma.\n4. The person who is a doctor is the person with a bachelor's degree.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nSolve the puzzle independently by following all clues carefully. In the beginning describe semantics of all relations like: in between, left, right next, etc - in a formal logic way using math expressions. After this describe all clues and conditions in a formal logic way with math expressions based on the relations. Proceed step by step using formal logic expressions, showing your reasoning at each stage. For every step: Represent the current state clearly in a table format for each house - number, name, education, color, nationality, birth_month.  Do not alter any positions or assignments that have already been confirmed as definitely correct. Include all relevant constraints and known facts before applying that step. Verify that the table satisfies the constraints up to that point. Keep records about conclusions that you found definitely wrong. Continue reasoning thoroughly until you reach a final consistent solution. After completing, double-check the entire solution against all constraints to ensure accuracy. When the final answer is found and verified provide it in full accordance with the template.\n\nFINAL ANSWER TEMPLATE:\n```json\n{\n    \"solution\": {\n        \"House 1\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 2\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        },\n        \"House 3\": {\n            \"Name\": \"___\",\n            \"Education\": \"___\",\n            \"Occupation\": \"___\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n",

                "thought": "**Analyzing Eric's Education**\n\nSo, I need to find out what education Eric has. He works as a teacher, but his education isn't directly linked to his occupation. It's either high school or bachelor\u2019s, while other names and jobs need to be assigned too. If I assume Eric has a high school education, that conflicts with our information. So, if it's true he has a bachelor\u2019s, then we can't have him in House 1. Therefore, Eric must be in House 3. This leads me to conclude A is in House 2."
